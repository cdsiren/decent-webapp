            It is traditionally accepted that signing with a label is a big break for an artists.  However, with social media and streaming platforms, labels are no longer gatekeepers to success.  In fact, the vast majority of artists independently create, distribute, and market their own music, somtimes without ever leaving their bedrooms. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            As a byproduct of this paradigm shift, indie artistsâ€™ fanbases have grown exponetially BUT their financial condition has remained unchanged.  This dichotemy is entirely illogical and a reminent of antiquated economics.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Currently, the relationship between artists and their fans is very deep but difficult to directly monetize.  Above all else, Decent promises to bridge this divide, allowing artists who SHOULD have a market, to actually have a market and capture the full value they create.

            Upfront capital and, more importantly, a fanbase properly incentivized to market on behalf of artists.  Your investors make money when your streams increase.

            Two things: 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            1) Decent is building the first protocol to bring royalties on chain, enabling artists to batch mint NFTs that are actually collateralized by their royalties.  
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            2) Decent is the first web3 platform offering flexible financing solutions for artists.  Decent's platform architecture allows artists to choose the percentage of their royalties that they would like to list and the amount of time for which they would like to let fans participate in their royalties.  
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This is a novel and uniquely strong approach to solve indie monetization, which was derived in collaboration with rising indie artists.
